# ðŸ§© Components

Based on our architectural patterns, tech stack, and comprehensive API design, here are the major logical components across the fullstack system:

## Frontend Components

```typescript
// Core UI Components
interface ComponentArchitecture {
  layout: {
    Shell: "Main app shell with navigation and search";
    Header: "Global search, notifications, user menu";
    Sidebar: "Quick access locations and filters";
    Footer: "Minimal footer with app info";
  };
  
  inventory: {
    ItemCard: "Visual item display with photos and actions";
    ItemModal: "Full item details with editing capabilities"; 
    ItemForm: "Add/edit item form with camera integration";
    BulkActions: "Multi-select operations and batch updates";
  };
  
  search: {
    SearchBar: "Global search with autocomplete and suggestions";
    SearchResults: "Paginated results with filters and sorting";
    SearchTips: "Contextual search education and tips";
    SavedSearches: "User's frequently used search queries";
  };
  
  camera: {
    CameraCapture: "Native camera integration with preview";
    PhotoEditor: "Basic crop, rotate, and enhancement tools";
    PhotoGallery: "Grid view of item photos with lightbox";
    PhotoUpload: "Drag-drop and batch photo processing";
  };
  
  locations: {
    LocationTree: "Hierarchical location browser";
    LocationBreadcrumbs: "Current location path navigation";
    LocationStats: "Usage analytics and optimization suggestions";
    QuickLocations: "Frequently accessed locations";
  };
  
  family: {
    FamilySetup: "Invitation and permission management";
    ActivityFeed: "Real-time family inventory updates";
    MemberManagement: "Add/remove family members and permissions";
    CoordinationAlerts: "Borrowed item notifications and reminders";
  };
}
```

## Backend Service Components

```typescript
interface ServiceArchitecture {
  core: {
    ItemsService: "CRUD operations with business logic validation";
    LocationsService: "Hierarchical location management with statistics";
    SearchService: "Full-text search with user pattern learning";
    PhotoService: "Image processing, optimization, and storage";
  };
  
  user: {
    AuthenticationService: "OAuth integration and session management";
    UserPreferencesService: "Adaptive UI and search preference learning";
    NotificationService: "Real-time notifications and email delivery";
    SubscriptionService: "Stripe integration and feature access control";
  };
  
  family: {
    HouseholdService: "Multi-user inventory sharing and coordination";
    PermissionService: "Fine-grained access control and validation";
    ActivityService: "Real-time activity tracking and notifications";
    InvitationService: "Family member invitation and onboarding";
  };
  
  data: {
    ExportService: "PDF, CSV, insurance document generation";
    ImportService: "Bulk data import with validation and progress tracking";
    BackupService: "Automated database backups and point-in-time recovery";
    AnalyticsService: "Usage analytics and system optimization insights";
  };
}
```

## Component Communication Patterns

- **State Management**: React 19 native state + Actions API for server mutations
- **Real-time Updates**: Server-Sent Events for family coordination and notifications  
- **Caching Strategy**: React Query for client state, Redis for server-side caching
- **Error Boundaries**: Hierarchical error handling with graceful degradation
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Domain events for decoupled component communication
