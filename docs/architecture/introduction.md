# ðŸ“‹ Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **NFC-Enabled Digital Inventory Management System**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the definitive technical blueprint for building a modern, scalable inventory management solution that bridges the gap between consumer simplicity and enterprise capability.

## Architecture Scope & Approach

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

The architecture is designed specifically for the unique challenges of household and small business inventory management:
- **Adaptive Search**: PostgreSQL full-text search with user pattern learning
- **Visual-First UX**: Camera integration with optimized photo processing pipeline
- **Progressive Complexity**: Scales from simple household use to enterprise deployment
- **Family Coordination**: Real-time sharing and notification systems
