# 🛡️ Risk Mitigation Strategy

This document outlines comprehensive risk mitigation strategies for the NFC-Enabled Digital Inventory Management System, based on the PO Master Checklist analysis and identified critical dependencies.

## 🎯 Risk Categories & Mitigation Framework

### **CATEGORY 1: External Service Dependencies**

#### Risk: AWS Services Unavailable or Cost Overruns
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Priority:** Critical

**Primary Mitigation Strategy:**
```yaml
AWS_Primary:
  - Billing alerts at $5 (warning) and $10 (critical)
  - S3 lifecycle policies: delete incomplete uploads after 1 day
  - CloudFront caching optimized for 30-day retention
  - IAM users with minimal S3-only permissions
  - Regional backup bucket configuration

Startup_Cost_Controls:
  - AWS Free Tier monitoring: Alerts at 80% of limits (4GB storage, 16K GET requests)
  - Conservative billing alerts: $2 (warning), $5 (critical) for early stage
  - Aggressive image compression: 100KB target, 500KB hard limit for MVP
  - Usage caps: Max 10 photos per user during free validation period
  - Free Tier preservation: Lifecycle policies delete test/demo data after 30 days
  - Monthly cost review during MVP phase to optimize spending
```

**Cost-Conscious Fallback Strategies:**
```yaml
Fallback_Level_1:
  Service: Vercel Blob Storage (10GB free, then $0.15/GB)
  Switch_Trigger: AWS Free Tier exhausted OR costs exceed $15/month
  Implementation: Abstract image service behind IImageService interface
  Migration_Time: 2 hours with feature flag switch
  Cost_Benefit: Cheaper than AWS post-free-tier, integrated with hosting
  
Fallback_Level_2:
  Service: Local filesystem with Vercel static serving
  Switch_Trigger: Monthly image storage costs >$25 OR extended cloud outage
  Implementation: Next.js public folder for development, Docker volumes for production
  Limitations: No CDN optimization, manual backup process
  Cost: $0 additional (included with Vercel hosting)
  
Fallback_Level_3:
  Service: Database BLOB storage (bootstrap emergency only)
  Switch_Trigger: All external storage failed >48 hours OR monthly costs >$30
  Implementation: PostgreSQL bytea columns with 300KB strict size limit
  Limitations: Database performance impact, no image optimization
  Cost: $0 (uses existing database)
  Max_Usage: MVP validation only, <100 users recommended
```

#### Risk: Authentication Provider Outages
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High | **Priority:** High

**Mitigation Strategy:**
```yaml
Multi_Provider_Setup:
  Primary: Google OAuth + GitHub OAuth
  Fallback_1: Email/password with magic links
  Fallback_2: Temporary guest mode with data export
  
Implementation:
  - NextAuth.js configured with provider priority ordering
  - Graceful degradation UI for failed OAuth attempts
  - Session-based auth backup for OAuth failures
  - User communication plan for extended outages

Provider_Monitoring:
  - Automated health checks every 5 minutes
  - Status page monitoring for Google/GitHub
  - Escalation procedures for >30 min outages
  - User notification system for service issues
```

### **CATEGORY 2: Dependency Sequencing Failures**

#### Risk: Image Infrastructure Delays Blocking Epic 1
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium | **Priority:** High

**Mitigation Timeline:**
```yaml
Week_1: Implement local photo storage as primary strategy
Week_2: AWS setup completion deadline (user action required)
Week_3: Migration to S3 OR continue with local storage
Week_4: Epic 1 completion with either photo strategy

Local_Storage_Implementation:
  - Organized filesystem: /uploads/users/{userId}/items/{itemId}/
  - Image processing with Sharp.js for consistency
  - File cleanup procedures for Epic 1 to Epic 2 migration
  - Database references prepared for URL migration

Decision_Gates:
  Day_5: If AWS setup incomplete, proceed with local storage
  Day_10: Final AWS setup attempt or commit to local strategy
  Day_14: Epic 1 completion regardless of storage backend
```

#### Risk: Search Performance Issues Discovered Late
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** High | **Priority:** Critical

**Early Detection Strategy:**
```yaml
Epic_1_Performance_Gates:
  - Search benchmarks with synthetic data (100, 500, 1000 items)
  - Response time SLA: <500ms for 100 items, <2s for 1000 items
  - Query performance logging from day 1
  - Load testing with PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE

Rapid_Response_Procedures:
  If_Performance_Below_Target:
    - Database index review and optimization (2-4 hours)
    - Query optimization with database consultant if needed
    - Search architecture review meeting within 24 hours
    - Epic 3 search optimization pulled forward if critical
    
Performance_Monitoring:
  - Automated alerting for >3s search responses
  - Daily performance reports during Epic 1
  - User experience metrics: task completion time
  - Search success rate tracking: target >90%
```
