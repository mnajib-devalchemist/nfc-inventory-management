# Epic 0: Foundation Setup (External Services)

**Epic Goal:** Complete all external service setup and account creation required for development and deployment. This epic ensures all third-party dependencies are properly configured before development begins, eliminating blocking issues during implementation.

## Story 0.1: External Services Account Setup & Configuration

**As a project owner,**
**I want all external service accounts created and configured with proper security policies,**
**so that development can proceed without dependency blockers or security vulnerabilities.**

### Acceptance Criteria:

#### AWS Account & S3 Infrastructure Setup
1. AWS account created with billing alerts configured at $10/month threshold
2. IAM user created with S3-only permissions (no root access)
3. S3 bucket created with proper CORS policies for web uploads
4. CloudFront CDN distribution configured for global image delivery
5. S3 lifecycle policies configured to optimize costs (delete incomplete uploads after 1 day)
6. Access keys generated and stored securely (not in code repository)
7. Billing dashboard monitoring configured with email alerts

#### Error Monitoring & Analytics Setup
1. Sentry account created (free tier sufficient for MVP)
2. New project created for inventory management application
3. DSN key generated for error tracking integration
4. Alert rules configured for critical errors (500 errors, database failures)
5. User feedback integration configured for error reporting
6. Performance monitoring enabled for API response times
7. Weekly error summary reports configured

#### Authentication Provider Configuration
1. OAuth applications registered with chosen providers (Google + GitHub recommended)
2. Callback URLs configured for development, staging, and production environments
3. Client IDs and secrets generated and stored securely
4. Email service provider selected and configured (Resend or SendGrid recommended)
5. Email templates created for verification and password reset
6. SMTP credentials configured and tested
7. Social login consent screens configured with proper branding

#### Development Environment Credentials
1. All service credentials documented in secure credential management system
2. Environment variable templates created for .env.local, staging, and production
3. Team access permissions configured for all external services
4. Backup access procedures documented for service recovery
5. Cost monitoring dashboards bookmarked and shared with team
6. Service status page monitoring configured for dependency tracking
7. Credential rotation schedule documented (quarterly recommended)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:

#### Cost Overrun Protection
- AWS billing alerts at $5 (warning) and $10 (critical)
- S3 request limits configured to prevent API abuse
- CloudFront usage monitoring with spending caps
- Daily cost review process for first month of operation

#### Service Availability Fallbacks
- Multiple OAuth providers configured (Google + GitHub + Email)
- Local development environment setup works without external services
- Graceful degradation documented for each service failure scenario
- Service status monitoring with automated team notifications

#### Security Best Practices
- IAM users with minimal required permissions only
- API keys stored in environment variables, never in code
- Regular credential rotation scheduled (quarterly)
- Multi-factor authentication enabled on all service accounts

### User Action Items:
This story requires **user completion** as it involves account creation, billing setup, and credential management that cannot be automated by development agents.

**Estimated Completion Time:** 2-4 hours
**Prerequisites:** Valid email address, payment method for AWS, decision on OAuth providers
**Deliverables:** Secure credential documentation, configured services, verified functionality

## Epic 0 Success Criteria:

✅ **All external service accounts active and properly configured**  
✅ **Security policies implemented and documented**  
✅ **Cost monitoring and alerts functional**  
✅ **Fallback strategies tested and verified**  
✅ **Team access and credential management established**

**Epic 0 must be 100% complete before Epic 1 development begins.**

This foundation ensures that development can proceed smoothly without external dependency blockers, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected cost overruns.
