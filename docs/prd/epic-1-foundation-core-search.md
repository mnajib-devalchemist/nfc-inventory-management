# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Search

**Epic Goal:** Establish technical foundation and deliver immediate "find my stuff" value through basic inventory management and PostgreSQL search functionality. This epic validates core value proposition early while building sustainable development infrastructure.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 0 must be completed before starting Epic 1. All external services (AWS, Sentry, OAuth providers) must be configured and accessible.

**Cost Optimization:** This epic uses temporary local storage initially (zero cost) to validate user workflows before AWS S3 migration. AWS Free Tier (5GB storage, 20K GET requests) will cover thousands of users during MVP validation phase at $0 cost.

## Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Development Environment
**As a developer,**
**I want a complete Next.js development environment with database and deployment pipeline,**
**so that I can build and deploy inventory features reliably.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Next.js 14+ project initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
2. PostgreSQL database running locally and on staging with Prisma ORM configured
3. Basic authentication system implemented using NextAuth.js with email/password signup
4. Deployment pipeline established on Vercel with staging and production environments
5. Error monitoring (Sentry) and basic analytics integrated for development feedback
6. CI/CD pipeline runs tests and deploys automatically on git push to main branch
7. Environment variables properly configured for database, authentication, and AWS services

## Story 1.2: Core Data Models & API Foundation
**As a user,**
**I want my inventory data stored securely with proper relationships,**
**so that my items and locations are managed reliably.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Database schema created for Users, Items, Locations with proper foreign key relationships
2. Prisma models defined supporting hierarchical location structure (Room → Container → Item)
3. Database migration strategy documented with rollback procedures and versioning
4. Development database seeding script created for consistent testing environment
5. API routes created for CRUD operations on items and locations with proper error handling
6. Basic data validation implemented for required fields (item name, location)
7. User authentication middleware protects all inventory API endpoints
8. Database queries optimized with proper indexing for text search performance
9. Database backup/restore procedures tested in development environment
10. API endpoints return consistent error messages and status codes

## Story 1.3: Basic Item Management Interface

**so that I can start building my searchable household database.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. "Add Item" form allows entry of item name, description, location, and optional quantity/value
2. Basic photo upload functionality using simple file input (no camera integration yet)
3. Image preview displays before save with basic client-side validation
4. Single photo per item supported for MVP validation
5. Photos stored temporarily in local filesystem with organized file structure
6. Location selector supports hierarchical structure with ability to create new locations
7. Form validation provides clear error messages for missing required fields
8. Items successfully save to database with proper user association
9. Basic item list displays added items with name, description, location, and photo thumbnail
10. Items can be edited and deleted through simple interface actions
11. Mobile-responsive design works well on smartphone screens for inventory building
12. Photo upload works reliably on both desktop and mobile browsers

## Story 1.4: Adaptive PostgreSQL Text Search Implementation
**As a household user,**
**I want to search across all my items using natural language and my own organizational terms,**
**so that I can quickly find things the way I think about them.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Search bar prominently displayed with placeholder text reflecting user's location naming patterns
2. Full-text search implemented using PostgreSQL's GIN indexes on tsvector columns
3. Search performance benchmarks established: <500ms for 100 items, <2s for 1000 items
4. Query optimization logging implemented for Epic 3 enhancement planning
5. Search queries match partial terms across item names, descriptions, and user's flexible location tags
6. Search algorithm prioritizes user-created location patterns and frequently accessed tags
7. Search results show item name, user's preferred location format, description snippet, and photo thumbnail
8. Empty search results display personalized suggestions based on user's location patterns
9. Search functionality adapts to user's naming style (formal hierarchy vs casual tags)
10. Search learns from user behavior to improve location tag relevance over time
11. Performance monitoring integrated to track search response times and success rates
12. Load testing completed with synthetic data (100, 500, 1000 items)

## Story 1.5: Search Results & Navigation
**As a household user,**
**I want search results displayed clearly with item locations and context,**
**so that I can quickly identify and locate the items I'm looking for.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Search results display in clean grid/list format with item information
2. Each result shows full location path (e.g., "Garage → Metal Shelf → Red Toolbox")  
3. Results include item description snippets highlighting search terms
4. Clicking on search result opens item detail view with full information
5. Search results indicate total count and provide "no results" guidance
6. Results loading state provides feedback during search processing
7. Search maintains user's query in search bar for easy modification

## Story 1.6: User Account Management & Security
**As a household user,**
**I want secure user account management with password recovery,**
**so that I can safely access my inventory data and recover my account if needed.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. OAuth provider integration tested with Google and GitHub (from Epic 0 setup)
2. Email/password registration with verification workflow using configured email service
3. NextAuth.js properly configured with multiple authentication providers
4. Password strength requirements defined and enforced (minimum 8 chars, special chars)
5. Login system with "remember me" functionality and secure session management
6. Password recovery workflow using email-based reset links with configured email service
7. Social login consent screens functional with proper application branding
8. User dashboard showing account information and basic inventory statistics
9. Logout functionality properly clears sessions and redirects to login
10. All user data properly isolated - users can only access their own inventory
11. Basic user preferences settings (email, password change) functional
12. Authentication middleware tested with all protected API endpoints

## Story 1.7: Production Image Infrastructure Migration
**As a system administrator,**
**I want to migrate temporary local photo storage to production AWS S3 infrastructure,**
**so that photos are stored securely and delivered efficiently through CDN while maintaining zero cost during MVP validation.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. AWS S3 integration implemented using credentials from Epic 0 setup
2. Sharp.js image processing pipeline compresses uploads to 100KB target size (optimized for Free Tier limits)
3. Automatic image resizing creates thumbnail (150x150) and full-size (max 1200px) versions
4. CloudFront CDN configured for fast global image delivery with optimized caching headers
5. Migration script transfers all existing local photos to S3 with preserved file references
6. Database photo URLs updated to reference S3/CloudFront endpoints
7. Local photo storage system cleanly removed after successful migration
8. Image upload API endpoints updated to use S3 direct upload with signed URLs
9. Error handling for S3 failures with automatic retry logic
10. **Cost optimization**: Usage monitoring to stay within AWS Free Tier limits (5GB storage, 20K GET, 2K PUT requests/month)
11. **Smart deletion**: Image deletion functionality properly removes files from S3 bucket to avoid unnecessary storage costs
12. **Free Tier monitoring**: Alerts when approaching 80% of Free Tier limits to prevent unexpected charges

## Story 1.8: Basic Data Export & Backup

**I want to export my inventory data for backup purposes,**
**so that I have confidence my cataloging work is safe and portable.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. CSV export functionality generates complete inventory data with all fields
2. Export includes item details, locations, quantities, values, timestamps, and photo URLs
