# Epic 2: Complete Visual Inventory Workflows

**Epic Goal:** Implement comprehensive item management including photo upload/compression, hierarchical location assignment, and visual browsing capabilities. Integrates essential UX elements to ensure quality inventory data for enhanced search functionality.

## Story 2.1: AWS S3 Image Infrastructure & Optimization

5. Automatic image resizing creates thumbnail and full-size versions
6. Error handling for failed uploads with clear user feedback messages
7. Cost monitoring alerts configured to prevent S3 storage cost overruns

## Story 2.2: Photo Upload & Camera Integration

4. Photo preview displays before final save with option to retake/reselect
5. Upload process completes within 30 seconds with clear success confirmation
6. Failed uploads provide specific error messages and retry options
7. Multiple photo support allows users to add several angles of same item

## Story 2.3: Enhanced Item Management with Photos
**As a household user,**
**I want to manage my items with photos and complete details,**
**so that I have comprehensive visual inventory records.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Item creation/edit forms integrate photo upload with description fields
2. Photo gallery view shows all item images with zoom capability

4. Photo editing allows users to crop, rotate, and set primary image
5. Item detail pages show full-size photos with swipe/navigation between images
6. Photo metadata preserved (date taken, device info) for reference
7. Delete confirmation prevents accidental photo removal

## Story 2.4: Flexible Location Tagging System
**As a household user,**
**I want to organize my storage locations in a way that matches my mental model of organization,**
**so that I can assign items to locations that help me find them later.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Location system supports both hierarchical paths (Room → Container) and flexible tags (#frequently-used, #seasonal-items)
2. Users can create freeform location strings like "garage-tools-frequently-used" or structured paths like "Kitchen → Pantry → Baking"
3. Location selector suggests both hierarchical structure and user's most-used location patterns
4. System learns and promotes user's personal location naming patterns through auto-suggest
5. Users can create new locations on-the-fly during item addition with smart suggestions based on existing patterns
6. Location editing preserves user's preferred naming style while maintaining searchability
7. Location statistics show most-used location patterns and suggest organization optimizations
8. Location search prioritizes user-created tags and commonly accessed location patterns

## Story 2.5: Adaptive Location Browsing Interface
**As a household user,**
**I want to browse my inventory using my own organizational patterns with visual previews,**
**so that I can explore what's stored in each area the way I think about it.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Location grid view displays user's location patterns (both hierarchical and tag-based) with representative item photos
2. Navigation adapts to user's preferred organization style: drill-down for hierarchical users, tag clusters for flexible users
3. Breadcrumb navigation shows location path in user's preferred format (formal hierarchy or natural tags)
4. Each location displays item count, total estimated value, and usage frequency indicators
5. "Quick add item here" button pre-fills location field with user's established patterns
6. Location browsing learns user preferences and promotes frequently accessed location patterns
7. Smart grouping suggests related locations based on user behavior (e.g., grouping "frequently-used-tools" and "garage-workbench")
8. Grid/list view adapts to location type: visual grid for physical spaces, list view for conceptual tags
9. Advanced filtering options: by location type, usage frequency, or item count
10. Location sharing capabilities for family coordination (preview of Epic 4 features)
11. Integration with location analytics to highlight optimization opportunities

## Story 2.6: Inventory Valuation & Statistics
**As a household user,**
**I want to see the total value and statistics of my inventory,**
**so that I understand my household assets and organization progress.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Dashboard displays total inventory value with breakdown by location
2. Statistics show total items, most valuable items, and recent additions
3. Value calculations handle items without prices gracefully (show totals for priced items)
4. Location-based value breakdowns help identify highest-value storage areas
5. Growth metrics show inventory building progress over time
6. Export functionality includes valuation data for insurance purposes
7. Privacy controls allow users to hide/show financial information

## Story 2.7: Mobile-Optimized Responsive Design
**As a household user,**
**I want the interface to work seamlessly on my smartphone and tablet,**
**so that I can manage inventory on-the-go and while physically organizing.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Mobile interface optimized for touch interactions with appropriate button sizes
2. Camera functionality works smoothly on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
3. Photo upload process provides clear feedback on mobile network connections
4. Navigation adapts to mobile screen sizes with collapsible menus
5. Search interface remains prominent and easily accessible on mobile
6. Form inputs properly handle mobile keyboards and autocomplete
7. Performance optimized for mobile devices with image lazy loading
