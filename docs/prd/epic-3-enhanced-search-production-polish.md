6. Interactive tutorials demonstrate search effectiveness using anonymized success stories
7. Onboarding optimization based on conversion metrics and search success rates from previous epics
8. A/B testing of onboarding flows with metrics: completion rate, first search success, 7-day retention
9. Personalized onboarding paths based on detected user organizational preferences
10. Integration with search analytics to provide real-time feedback during onboarding
11. Success metrics dashboard: search success rate, time to first successful search, user engagement
12. Continuous onboarding improvement using Epic 1 and 2 user feedback data

## Story 3.4: Enhanced Data Management & Import
**As a household user,**
**I want to import existing inventory data and manage bulk operations,**
**so that I can migrate from spreadsheets or other systems efficiently.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. CSV import functionality processes existing inventory spreadsheets
2. Import mapping interface allows users to match columns to item fields
3. Bulk edit operations enable updating multiple items simultaneously
4. Duplicate detection warns about potentially duplicate items during import
5. Import validation provides clear feedback on data quality issues
6. Bulk operations (delete, move, update location) work on selected items
7. Import history tracks previous imports with rollback capability

## Story 3.5: Production Performance & Monitoring
**As a system administrator,**
**I want comprehensive monitoring and performance optimization,**
**so that the application runs reliably for all users.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
