# Epic List

Here are the restructured high-level epics that deliver faster user validation while maintaining complete MVP functionality. Each epic delivers significant, end-to-end value with accelerated feedback cycles:

**⚠️ CRITICAL PREREQUISITE ⚠️**
**Epic 0: Foundation Setup (External Services)** must be completed before any development begins. This user-action epic ensures all external service dependencies (AWS, Sentry, OAuth providers) are resolved to prevent blocking issues during development.

---

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Search**
Establish project infrastructure, authentication, database schema, and basic PostgreSQL search functionality to deliver immediate "find my stuff" value. Users can add items with descriptions and search across their inventory, validating core value proposition early.

**Epic 2: Complete Visual Inventory Workflows**
Implement comprehensive item management including photo upload/compression, hierarchical location assignment (Room → Container → Item), and visual browsing capabilities. Integrates essential UX elements to ensure quality inventory data for enhanced search.

**Epic 3: Enhanced Search & Production Polish**
Deliver advanced search features (suggestions, filters, natural language improvements), responsive design optimization, onboarding workflows, and production-ready performance. Includes data export and user account management for launch readiness.

**Rationale for Restructured Epic Approach:**
- **Epic 0** resolves all external service dependencies upfront to prevent development blockers (2-4 hours user time)
- **Epic 1** combines infrastructure with core search value for immediate user validation and feedback (8-10 weeks)
- **Epic 2** focuses on complete inventory workflows with integrated UX to ensure data quality for search effectiveness (6-8 weeks)  
- **Epic 3** enhances search capabilities and adds production polish based on Epic 1-2 user feedback (4-6 weeks)
- **Total Timeline:** 18-24 weeks development + Epic 0 prerequisites with built-in user feedback cycles

**Critical Success Dependencies Addressed:**
- **Search validation early:** Epic 1 delivers basic search for immediate value proposition testing
- **Quality data foundation:** Epic 2 ensures proper inventory workflows before advanced search features
- **Integrated UX approach:** Essential user experience elements distributed across epics vs deferred to end
- **Market feedback cycles:** 3 deployment milestones vs 4, enabling faster iteration and validation

**Resource Requirements (Revised):**
- **Epic 1:** 240-280 hours (combines foundation + basic search for meaningful user value)
- **Epic 2:** 180-220 hours (focused inventory workflows with integrated UX elements)  
- **Epic 3:** 120-160 hours (search enhancement + final polish based on user feedback)
- **Total:** 540-660 hours (more realistic than previous 580-740 hour estimate with better scope control)
