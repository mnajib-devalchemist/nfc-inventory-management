# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**Core Inventory Management (MVP Scope):**
- **FR1:** Users can add items with description, photo, location (room/container hierarchy), quantity, and optional cost/purchase information through streamlined form interface
- **FR2:** System supports hierarchical location structure: Room → Storage Unit → Container, mirroring real household organization patterns
- **FR3:** Users can upload and store item photos with automatic compression and optimization to control storage costs (target 100KB per image)
- **FR4:** System provides visual item catalog organized by location, allowing users to browse storage contents before physical searching

**Search and Discovery (MVP Scope):**
- **FR5:** PostgreSQL-based text search across item descriptions, locations, and notes with basic partial matching capabilities
- **FR6:** Search results display item location path, photo thumbnail, and relevant context within 5-second response time (realistic performance target)
- **FR7:** Search suggestions based on user's existing inventory terms to improve query accuracy and success rates
- **FR8:** Users receive search tips and best practices to improve description quality and findability

**Data Management and Export (MVP Scope):**
- **FR9:** Users can export complete inventory data to CSV format for backup and insurance documentation purposes
- **FR10:** System calculates and displays total inventory valuation across all locations automatically
- **FR11:** Basic user account management with secure authentication and password recovery

**Post-MVP Features (Future Phases):**
- **FR12:** Multiple household members can access shared inventory with role-based permissions (view-only, edit items, admin)
- **FR13:** System tracks item history including who added, moved, or modified items with timestamp logging
- **FR14:** Users can mark items as "borrowed," "lent," or "moved" with optional notes about current location or borrower
- **FR15:** Advanced search filters by location, date added, value range, and custom tags for power users
- **FR16:** Bulk import functionality allows users to upload existing inventory data from spreadsheets

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance and Scalability (MVP Scope):**
- **NFR1:** Search queries return results within 5 seconds for inventories up to 500 items (realistic PostgreSQL performance)
- **NFR2:** Image upload completes within 30 seconds with progress indicators and background processing to improve perceived performance
- **NFR3:** System maintains 99% uptime availability with graceful degradation during maintenance periods
- **NFR4:** Progressive Web App (PWA) provides responsive mobile experience without initial native app development

**Security and Privacy (MVP Scope):**
- **NFR5:** All user data encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols
- **NFR6:** User photos and inventory data remain private with no data sharing or selling to third parties
- **NFR7:** GDPR compliance including user data export and deletion capabilities for EU users
- **NFR8:** Secure image upload with basic content validation to prevent malicious file uploads

**Cost and Resource Management (MVP Scope):**
- **NFR9:** AWS service usage optimized for bootstrap budget: $300/month operational costs for first 500 users
- **NFR10:** Image storage costs controlled through aggressive compression (100KB target), resizing, and CDN optimization
- **NFR11:** Database queries optimized for cost-effective PostgreSQL usage with connection pooling and query optimization

**Search Enhancement Budget (Post-MVP):**
- **NFR12:** $2,000 allocated for search system upgrade (Elasticsearch migration) if PostgreSQL performance inadequate
- **NFR13:** AI-powered search enhancements for natural language queries and synonym matching in future phases

**Usability and Accessibility (MVP Scope):**
- **NFR14:** Interface supports responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers with touch-optimized interactions
- **NFR15:** System provides clear error messages and guidance for failed searches with suggestions for improvement
- **NFR16:** Onboarding workflow guides new users through adding first 10 items with progress tracking and success tips
