# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The interface should feel like **"Google Search meets photo album"** - instantly familiar search-first design with visual browsing capabilities. Users should be able to find items through either text search or visual location browsing, with the system guiding them toward successful outcomes. The experience should feel more like using a modern web app (Notion, Airtable) than traditional inventory software, emphasizing speed and simplicity over feature complexity.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Search-First Interface:** Primary action is always "search your stuff" with prominent search bar
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features hidden until needed, preventing overwhelming new users
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Location-based organization mirrors real household storage patterns
- **Mobile-First Responsive:** Optimized for smartphone photography and on-the-go searching
- **Confidence Building:** Clear feedback and success indicators to build user trust in the system

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Search-Centric Navigation:** 
- Prominent search bar as primary interface element (similar to Google homepage)
- Auto-suggest dropdown with item names, locations, and recent searches
- Search results with visual previews and clear location hierarchies
- "Did you mean...?" suggestions for failed searches

**Photo-First Item Addition:**
- Camera-first item addition workflow (mobile) with optional description fields
- Drag-and-drop photo upload (desktop) with batch processing capabilities
- Visual feedback during compression and upload with progress indicators
- Location assignment through hierarchical dropdown (Room → Container)

**Location-Based Browsing:**
- Visual room/container navigation as alternative to search
- Grid view of locations with item count and representative photos
- Drill-down navigation: House → Room → Container → Items
- "Quick Add" buttons at each location level for rapid inventory building

## Core Screens and Views

Based on user workflows and MVP scope, the critical screens necessary to deliver PRD value:

**Dashboard/Home Screen:**
- Prominent search bar with recent searches and suggestions
- Quick stats: total items, total value, recent additions
- Visual grid of rooms/locations with item counts and photos
- "Add Item" floating action button for immediate inventory building

**Search Results Screen:**
- Grid/list toggle for results display with photo thumbnails
- Location breadcrumbs showing full path (Garage → Metal Shelf → Red Toolbox)
- Filter sidebar by location, value range, date added (progressive disclosure)
- "Item not found?" help section with search tips

**Item Detail/Edit Screen:**
- Full-size photo with edit capabilities and zoom
- Editable fields: description, location, quantity, value, notes
- Location assignment with visual hierarchy selector
- "Mark as moved/borrowed/lent" status options (post-MVP)

**Add Item Screen:**
- Photo upload (camera or file) as primary action
- Smart form with required fields (name, location) and optional details
- Location selector with visual hierarchy and quick-add location option
- Preview mode showing how item will appear in search results

**Browse by Location Screen:**
- Visual hierarchy navigation (breadcrumbs + drill-down)
- Grid view of containers/items at current location level
- "Add item here" quick action for location-specific additions
- Search within current location option

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

**Color and Contrast:**
- High contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum) for all text and interactive elements
- Color not used as sole means of conveying information (search results, status indicators)
- Dark mode support for improved usability in storage areas (basements, attics)

**Navigation and Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Focus indicators clearly visible and properly ordered
- Screen reader compatible with proper heading structure and alt text
- Touch targets minimum 44px for mobile accessibility

**Content and Readability:**
- Clear, simple language avoiding technical jargon
- Consistent navigation patterns and terminology throughout
- Error messages provide clear guidance for resolution
- Help text and tooltips for complex features

## Branding

**Visual Identity:**
- Clean, modern aesthetic similar to productivity apps (Notion, Linear, Stripe)
- Primary color palette: Deep blue (#1e40af) for trust and reliability, complemented by neutral grays
- Typography: System fonts (SF Pro, Segoe UI, Roboto) for familiar, readable experience
- Photography style: Clean product shots with consistent lighting and backgrounds

**Tone and Voice:**
- Friendly but efficient - "Found it!" success messages, helpful error guidance
- Encouraging during onboarding - "Great start! Add 5 more items to unlock search tips"
- Professional for business features without being intimidating for household users
- Problem-solving focused: "Can't find it? Try searching for..." suggestions

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary Platforms:**
- **Desktop Web:** Full-featured experience for bulk item addition and management
- **Mobile Web (PWA):** Optimized for photography, quick searches, and on-the-go access
- **Tablet Web:** Hybrid experience good for both browsing and data entry

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320-768px (single column, touch-optimized, camera-first)
- Tablet: 769-1024px (two-column layout, enhanced touch targets)
- Desktop: 1025px+ (multi-column, keyboard shortcuts, advanced features)

**Progressive Web App Features:**
- Offline search capability for previously cached inventory
- Camera integration for seamless photo capture
- Push notifications for family sharing features (post-MVP)
- App-like experience without app store distribution complexity
