## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Authentication Security (SEC-001)**
- OAuth flow penetration testing
- Session hijacking attempts
- CSRF vulnerability testing
- Multi-provider authentication testing
- Rate limiting bypass attempts

**Database Migration Safety (DATA-001)**
- Schema migration rollback testing
- Cross-environment data consistency validation
- Backup and restore procedure testing
- Connection failure recovery testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Environment Security (SEC-002)**
- Environment variable exposure scanning
- Secret detection in logs and responses
- Configuration validation across environments

**NextAuth.js Stability (TECH-001)**
- Beta version compatibility testing
- Fallback mechanism validation
- Session persistence testing

**CI/CD Reliability (OPS-001)**
- Pipeline failure recovery testing
- Deployment rollback procedures
- Automated testing reliability

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Performance Impact Testing (PERF-001)**
- Monitoring overhead measurement
- Load time impact analysis
- Resource usage monitoring

**Component Integration (TECH-002)**
- shadcn/ui component compatibility
- Style conflict detection
- Responsive design validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **SEC-001**: Implement comprehensive auth security measures
- **DATA-001**: Establish bulletproof migration and backup procedures
- **SEC-002**: Secure all environment variables and secrets

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **TECH-001**: Monitor NextAuth.js v5 beta closely, prepare v4 fallback
- **OPS-001**: Implement monitoring and alerting for pipeline health
- **PERF-001**: Set performance budgets and monitoring

### Accepted Risks

- **PERF-002**: Bundle size optimization can be addressed post-launch
- **OPS-002**: Basic Vercel configuration sufficient for MVP

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Authentication metrics**: Login success rates, OAuth failures, session timeouts
- **Database health**: Connection pool status, query performance, migration success
- **Deployment pipeline**: Build success rates, deployment duration, rollback frequency
- **Performance metrics**: Page load times, API response times, error rates
- **Security alerts**: Failed authentication attempts, suspicious activity patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- NextAuth.js v5 moves from beta to stable
- Database schema changes significantly  
- New authentication providers added
- Performance issues reported in production
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in dependencies
- Regulatory or compliance requirements change

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)

1. **Implement comprehensive authentication testing** - Security audit of all auth flows
2. **Create database disaster recovery plan** - Backup, restore, and rollback procedures  
3. **Secure environment variable management** - Use proper secret management
4. **Set up monitoring and alerting** - Comprehensive observability

### Short-term Improvements (Next Sprint)

1. **Performance testing and optimization** - Establish performance baselines
2. **Automated security scanning** - Integrate SAST/DAST tools
3. **Chaos engineering** - Test system resilience
4. **Documentation and runbooks** - Operational procedures

### Long-term Enhancements (Future Releases)
