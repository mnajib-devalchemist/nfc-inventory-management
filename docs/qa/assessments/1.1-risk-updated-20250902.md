## Risks Eliminated by PostgreSQL AWS Approach

### âœ… **DATA-001**: Database Migration Risk (Was Critical - Score 9)
**Eliminated**: No SQLite-to-PostgreSQL transition needed
**Impact**: Single consistent database technology across all environments

### âœ… **TECH-003**: Database Environment Consistency (Was Medium - Score 4)  
**Eliminated**: PostgreSQL used consistently in development and production
**Impact**: No cross-database compatibility issues

### âœ… **DATA-002**: Data Consistency Issues (Was Medium - Score 4)
**Eliminated**: Same PostgreSQL engine across environments
**Impact**: Consistent behavior and data types

## New Risks Introduced by AWS PostgreSQL

### ðŸ†• **AWS-001**: Connection Pool Management (High Priority)
**Risk**: AWS RDS has connection limits that could cause application failures
**Mitigation**: Configure Prisma connection pooling, implement connection monitoring

### ðŸ†• **AWS-002**: Network Latency (Low Priority)  
**Risk**: Increased database latency compared to local SQLite
**Mitigation**: Optimize queries, implement appropriate caching

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Authentication Security (SEC-001)**
- OAuth provider integration testing
- Session security and CSRF validation
- Multi-factor authentication flows
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- JWT token validation and expiry

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**AWS Database Integration (AWS-001)**
- Connection pool exhaustion testing
- Database connection failure recovery
- High concurrent connection testing
- Connection timeout handling

**AWS Security (SEC-002)**
- Credential rotation procedures
- IAM role validation
- VPC security group testing
- Environment variable security

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests

**Application Performance (PERF-001)**
- Database query latency measurement
- Connection pool performance
- Regional latency testing

**CI/CD with AWS (OPS-001)**
- AWS credential integration in pipelines
- Database migration automation
- Environment-specific deployments

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **SEC-001**: Comprehensive authentication security audit
- **AWS-001**: Production-grade connection pool configuration
- **SEC-002**: Secure AWS credential management

### Can Deploy with Mitigation  

- **TECH-001**: Monitor NextAuth.js complexity, document configuration
- **OPS-001**: Basic CI/CD working, improve incrementally
- **DATA-001**: AWS RDS backup configured per AWS best practices

### Accepted Risks

- **PERF-001**: Acceptable latency for MVP, optimize post-launch
- **TECH-002**: Standard Prisma-RDS integration
- **OPS-002**: Basic Vercel-AWS integration sufficient

## AWS-Specific Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Database performance**: Query performance, connection counts, CPU/memory usage
- **AWS costs**: RDS usage, data transfer costs, connection costs
- **Security metrics**: Failed authentication attempts, unusual access patterns
- **Infrastructure health**: RDS availability, backup success, VPC connectivity
- **Performance metrics**: Database latency, connection pool utilization

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)

1. **Configure production-grade RDS setup** - Connection pooling, backup strategy
2. **Implement AWS security best practices** - IAM roles, VPC configuration
3. **Set up comprehensive monitoring** - RDS metrics, application performance
4. **Test disaster recovery procedures** - Backup restoration, failover testing

### Short-term Improvements (Next Sprint)

1. **Database performance optimization** - Query analysis, indexing strategy
2. **Cost optimization** - RDS instance right-sizing, reserved instances
3. **Security hardening** - Additional AWS security controls
4. **Automated testing** - Integration tests with AWS services

### Long-term Enhancements (Future Releases)

1. **Multi-region setup** - High availability and disaster recovery
2. **Advanced monitoring** - Custom CloudWatch dashboards, alerts
3. **Performance scaling** - Read replicas, connection pooling optimization
4. **Security automation** - Automated security scanning, compliance monitoring
