# Risk Profile: Story 1.8

Date: 2025-09-14
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 74/100 (moderate risk)

## High Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Data Privacy Breach via Export

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex database queries with user filtering have potential for bugs
**Impact**: High - Could expose other users' private inventory data, photos, and personal information
**Mitigation**:

- Implement strict user ID validation with household membership verification
- Add row-level security policies in database queries
- Create comprehensive unit tests specifically for data isolation scenarios
- Add integration tests with multiple user accounts to verify data separation

**Testing Focus**: Multi-user security testing with boundary conditions

### 2. PERF-001: System Timeout on Large Exports

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - 500+ item exports with photo URLs and complex joins likely to hit timeout limits
**Impact**: Medium - Export failure frustrates users but doesn't corrupt data
**Mitigation**:

- Implement background job processing with WebSocket or polling for status updates
- Add streaming CSV generation to reduce memory footprint
- Create chunked processing for datasets over 100 items
- Set appropriate timeout configurations for different export sizes

**Testing Focus**: Load testing with varying dataset sizes (100, 500, 1000+ items)

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

**Security Isolation Testing**
- Multi-user account setup with different households
- Attempt cross-user data access through export APIs
- Validate household membership enforcement
- Test edge cases: shared households, removed users

**Performance & Scalability Testing**
- Export datasets of varying sizes: 50, 100, 500, 1000+ items
- Concurrent export request testing
- Memory usage monitoring during large exports
- Background job completion verification

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

**Photo URL Security**
- Verify photo URL ownership validation
- Test photo access from exported CSV files
- CloudFront URL integrity testing

**Job Processing Reliability**
- Background job failure scenarios
- Error notification and recovery testing
- Progress tracking accuracy validation

### Priority 3: Standard Tests

**CSV Format Compatibility**
- Excel import/export validation
- Google Sheets compatibility testing
- Special character handling verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: Data privacy breach (Score 6)
- PERF-001: System timeout on large exports (Score 6)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- SEC-002: Photo URL exposure (Score 4) - With photo ownership validation
- OPS-001: Background job failure (Score 4) - With proper error handling
- TECH-001: Memory exhaustion (Score 4) - With streaming implementation

### Accepted Risks

- DATA-002: CSV corruption (Score 3) - Industry-standard CSV libraries mitigate
- BUS-001: Spreadsheet compatibility (Score 2) - CSV format widely supported

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Export completion rates and failure patterns
- Large dataset processing times and memory usage
- Background job success/failure metrics
- User complaints about data accessibility or corruption
- CloudFront photo URL accessibility rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Export dataset size patterns change significantly
- New photo storage or CDN changes implemented
- User feedback indicates data integrity issues
- Performance metrics degrade below acceptable thresholds
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in export functionality
