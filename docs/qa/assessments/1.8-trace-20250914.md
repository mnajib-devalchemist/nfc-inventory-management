**COVERAGE GAP**: Photo ownership validation testing is not fully implemented in current test suite

### Critical Gaps

#### GAP-001: Photo Ownership Cross-User Validation
- **Requirement**: AC9 - User authentication and data isolation
- **Gap**: No comprehensive test for photo URL ownership validation across different users
- **Risk**: Medium - Potential photo URL exposure to unauthorized users
- **Action**: Add test case to verify photo ownership validation prevents cross-user photo access

**Suggested Test**:
```typescript
// tests/unit/services/exports.test.ts
it('should validate photo ownership and prevent cross-user photo access', async () => {
  // Given: User A has photos, User B requests export
  // When: User B's export is generated
  // Then: User A's photo URLs are not included in User B's export
});
```

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Enhanced Photo Security Testing**
   - Add comprehensive photo ownership validation tests
   - Test edge cases where photos might be referenced across households
   - Verify CloudFront URL security with different user contexts

2. **E2E Spreadsheet Compatibility Testing**
   - Test actual CSV import into Excel and Google Sheets
   - Verify complex data (Unicode, special characters) renders correctly
   - Test large dataset imports in spreadsheet applications

3. **Performance Boundary Testing**
   - Test exact 500-item threshold behavior
   - Verify memory usage stays within 100MB limit
   - Test timeout scenarios with various dataset sizes

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All critical security and performance requirements have comprehensive coverage
- **Medium Risk**: Photo ownership validation (GAP-001) - Has partial coverage but needs enhancement
- **Low Risk**: Spreadsheet compatibility edge cases - Good coverage but could be enhanced with E2E testing
