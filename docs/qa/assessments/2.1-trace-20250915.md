Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `tests/integration/photos/photo-upload-security.test.ts`
  - Given: Upload request with JPEG, PNG, or HEIC format
  - When: API endpoint validates file format
  - Then: Valid formats are accepted, invalid formats are rejected

- **Unit Test**: `tests/unit/utils/file-validation.test.ts`
  - Given: File buffer with specific MIME type
  - When: Format validation is executed
  - Then: Correct format identification and validation occurs

- **API Implementation**: `app/api/v1/items/[id]/photos/route.ts`
  - Given: Authenticated user uploading photo
  - When: POST request with multipart form data
  - Then: Format validation and processing pipeline executes

#### AC5: Automatic image resizing creates thumbnail and full-size versions

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `lib/services/photo-processing.ts` (multi-format processing)
  - Given: Original image requiring thumbnail generation
  - When: Processing service creates resized versions
  - Then: 200x200 thumbnail and 1920x1080 max full-size versions are generated

**Coverage Gap**: Missing explicit unit tests for thumbnail generation edge cases

#### AC6: Error handling for failed uploads with clear user feedback messages

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `tests/integration/photos/photo-upload-security.test.ts`
  - Given: Malicious file upload attempt
  - When: Security validation detects threat
  - Then: Clear error message returned to user

- **Unit Test**: `tests/unit/services/storage.test.ts`
  - Given: S3 upload failure scenario
  - When: Storage service handles AWS errors
  - Then: User-friendly error messages are generated

- **API Implementation**: `app/api/v1/items/[id]/photos/route.ts`
  - Given: Upload failure at any stage
  - When: Error handling middleware catches exception
  - Then: Structured error response with clear feedback

#### AC7: Cost monitoring alerts configured to prevent S3 storage cost overruns

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `tests/unit/services/cost-protection.test.ts`
  - Given: AWS usage tracking approaching limits
  - When: Cost protection service evaluates usage
  - Then: Circuit breaker triggers service suspension

- **Implementation**: `lib/services/cost-protection.ts`
  - Given: CloudWatch metrics indicating cost escalation
  - When: Real-time monitoring detects threshold breach
  - Then: Automatic service suspension with alerts

**Coverage Gap**: Missing integration tests for CloudWatch alert configuration

### Critical Gaps

1. **Thumbnail Generation Edge Cases**
   - Gap: No specific tests for thumbnail generation failure scenarios
   - Risk: Medium - Could fail with corrupted input images
   - Action: Add unit tests for thumbnail generation error handling

2. **CloudWatch Integration Testing**
   - Gap: No integration tests for CloudWatch alerts setup
   - Risk: Medium - Cost protection may not trigger correctly in production
   - Action: Add integration tests for cost monitoring alerts

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Additional Unit Tests Needed**
   - Thumbnail generation edge cases with corrupted images
   - Sharp.js worker thread fallback scenarios
   - Multi-format progressive enhancement testing

2. **Integration Tests to Implement**
   - End-to-end photo upload with CDN invalidation
   - Cost protection circuit breaker full workflow
   - CloudWatch metrics collection and alerting

3. **Performance Tests Required**
   - Concurrent upload handling under load
   - Memory usage during Sharp.js processing
   - S3 upload timeout and retry scenarios

4. **Security Tests Enhancement**
   - MIME type bypass attempts
   - File upload size limit enforcement
   - Presigned URL expiration and abuse testing

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Requirements with no coverage - None identified
- **Medium Risk**: Requirements with partial coverage:
  - AC5: Thumbnail generation edge cases
  - AC7: CloudWatch alerts integration
- **Low Risk**: Requirements with full unit + integration coverage:
  - AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4, AC6

### Production Readiness Assessment

**Overall Test Coverage: 86%** - Strong foundation with identified gaps

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive security testing for file uploads
- Strong cost protection circuit breaker implementation
- Multi-format image processing thoroughly tested
- S3 integration with proper error handling

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Add missing thumbnail generation edge case tests
- Implement CloudWatch integration testing
- Enhance performance testing for concurrent scenarios
- Add comprehensive end-to-end workflow testing

### Quality Gate Recommendation

**PASS** - with minor concerns addressed

**Rationale:**
- All critical acceptance criteria have test coverage
- Security aspects thoroughly validated
- Cost protection mechanisms properly tested
- Only minor gaps in edge case scenarios

**Required Actions Before Production:**
1. Add thumbnail generation edge case tests (Priority: Medium)
2. Implement CloudWatch alerts integration testing (Priority: Medium)
3. Enhance concurrent upload performance testing (Priority: Low)
