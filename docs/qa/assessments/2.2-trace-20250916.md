### Critical Gaps

1. **Camera Functionality (HIGH RISK)**
   - Gap: No tests for camera integration, device switching, or capture
   - Risk: Core feature may fail on target devices
   - Action: Implement browser automation tests with camera mocking

2. **Safari Compatibility (HIGH RISK)**
   - Gap: No iOS Safari specific testing
   - Risk: Primary mobile platform unusable
   - Action: Add Safari-specific test scenarios and constraints

3. **HEIC Support (MEDIUM RISK)**
   - Gap: No tests for HEIC validation or conversion
   - Risk: iPhone users unable to upload photos
   - Action: Add HEIC file processing tests with security validation

4. **PWA Infrastructure (HIGH RISK)**
   - Gap: No tests for service worker or offline functionality
   - Risk: Core mobile experience broken
   - Action: Add PWA functionality tests

5. **Performance Requirements (HIGH RISK)**
   - Gap: No load testing for 30-second upload requirement
   - Risk: Performance SLA violations
   - Action: Implement performance test suite

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Browser Automation Tests**
   - Camera permission workflows
   - Device switching functionality
   - Cross-browser compatibility (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)

2. **Unit Tests for New Components**
   - CameraCapture component with mock MediaDevices API
   - PhotoUpload drag-and-drop functionality
   - HEIC validation and conversion utilities

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Complete photo capture and upload workflow
   - PWA manifest and service worker registration
   - Offline queue and sync functionality

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Upload timing validation (30-second requirement)
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Large file handling with progress tracking

5. **Security Tests**
   - HEIC file header validation
   - Camera permission security boundaries
   - File upload security with HEIC support

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Requirements with no coverage affecting core functionality
  - Camera integration (AC1)
  - PWA infrastructure (PWA1, PWA2)
  - Safari compatibility (SAFARI1, SAFARI2)
  - Performance SLAs (AC5)

- **Medium Risk**: Requirements with partial coverage
  - Error handling (AC6) - good coverage
  - Image processing (PERF1) - basic coverage

- **Low Risk**: Requirements with full coverage
  - File validation security (comprehensive)
  - Error message handling (well covered)

### Implementation Priority

**P0 (Critical)**: Camera functionality, Safari compatibility, PWA infrastructure
**P1 (High)**: HEIC support, performance testing, drag-and-drop
**P2 (Medium)**: Memory management, state machine testing
**P3 (Low)**: Enhancement scenarios, edge cases
