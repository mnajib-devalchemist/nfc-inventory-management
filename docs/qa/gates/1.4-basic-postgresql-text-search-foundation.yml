gate_decision_rationale: |
  This implementation represents exceptional technical quality with comprehensive architecture,
  robust security, and production-ready code. All 12 acceptance criteria are fully implemented
  with outstanding attention to detail. However, the complete absence of search-specific tests
  creates unacceptable risk for a core feature with complex fallback logic. The testing gap
  must be addressed before production deployment despite the excellent implementation quality.
