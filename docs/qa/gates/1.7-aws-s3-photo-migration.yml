  TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE: This story represents exceptional engineering excellence
  with a complete, production-ready AWS migration system. All previously identified
  gaps have been resolved:

  âœ… RESOLVED: Image processing worker with Sharp.js multi-format processing
  âœ… RESOLVED: Migration orchestrator with complete local photo reading logic
  âœ… RESOLVED: CDN service with CloudFront integration and cache management
  âœ… RESOLVED: Comprehensive test coverage for all critical services

  The implementation now demonstrates:

  - Circuit breaker cost protection with 90% Free Tier thresholds
  - Complete multi-format image processing (WebP, AVIF, JPEG) with adaptive quality
  - Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms throughout
  - S3 lifecycle management for automated cost optimization
  - Real-time CloudWatch monitoring with intelligent caching
  - Atomic migration with rollback capabilities and progress tracking
  - Worker thread isolation for CPU-intensive processing
  - Full CloudFront CDN integration with cache invalidation

  This system now represents an exemplary cloud migration architecture with:
  - Production-ready reliability and comprehensive error handling
  - Enterprise-grade security and cost protection
  - Optimized performance with multi-format processing
  - Complete test coverage for production confidence

  **READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT** ðŸš€
