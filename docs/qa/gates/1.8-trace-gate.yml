      severity: 'medium'
      requirement: 'AC9'
      suggested_test: 'Verify photo ownership validation prevents cross-user photo access'
  recommendations:
    - 'Add comprehensive photo ownership validation tests'
    - 'Implement E2E spreadsheet compatibility testing'
    - 'Enhance performance boundary testing at 500-item threshold'
  notes: 'Excellent coverage overall. All critical security and performance requirements have comprehensive test mappings. Minor gap in photo ownership validation needs addressing.'
