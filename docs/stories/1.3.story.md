## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.2 Foundation** - Complete API infrastructure established with Items/Locations endpoints, Prisma models, authentication middleware, validation schemas, and service layer. Household security context implemented. Database seeded with development test data.

### Component Specifications
**Frontend Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, architecture/components.md]

**React 19 + Next.js 15.2 Frontend Stack:**
- **React 19 Features**: Use `useActionState` for form state management, `useOptimistic` for immediate UI updates
- **Next.js 15.2**: App Router with server actions for form handling, built-in image optimization
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Button, Input, Form, Dialog, Card, Badge for UI building blocks
- **Custom Components**: ItemCard, ItemForm, PhotoUpload, LocationSelector for inventory-specific features

**Key Frontend Components to Build:**
```typescript
// Component Structure from Architecture
components/
├── inventory/
│   ├── ItemCard.tsx         # Individual item display with photos and actions
│   ├── ItemModal.tsx        # Full item details with editing capabilities
│   ├── ItemForm.tsx         # Add/edit item form with photo integration
│   ├── ItemGrid.tsx         # Grid layout for items
├── camera/
│   ├── PhotoUpload.tsx      # Drag-drop and file input photo processing
│   ├── OptimizedImage.tsx   # Image optimization wrapper
├── locations/
│   ├── LocationSelector.tsx # Hierarchical location dropdown
│   ├── LocationBreadcrumbs.tsx # Current location path navigation
└── ui/                      # shadcn/ui base components
    ├── button.tsx, input.tsx, form.tsx, dialog.tsx, card.tsx
```

**State Management Pattern:**
```typescript
// React 19 useActionState pattern for forms
import { useActionState } from 'react';
import { createItemAction } from '@/lib/actions/items';

export function ItemForm() {
  const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(createItemAction, {
    success: false,
    error: null,
  });
  
  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      {/* Form implementation with optimistic updates */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

### API Specifications  
**Existing API Infrastructure from Story 1.2** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Available API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/items` - Create new item (validation, authentication, household context)
- `GET /api/v1/items` - List items with pagination and filtering  
- `PATCH /api/v1/items/{id}` - Update item details
- `DELETE /api/v1/items/{id}` - Delete item (soft delete)
- `GET /api/v1/locations` - List locations in hierarchy
- `POST /api/v1/locations` - Create new location

**Server Actions to Create:**
```typescript
// lib/actions/items.ts - Server Actions for form handling
'use server';

export async function createItemAction(formData: FormData) {
  const validatedFields = CreateItemSchema.safeParse({
    name: formData.get('name'),
    description: formData.get('description'),
    locationId: formData.get('locationId'),
  });
  
  if (!validatedFields.success) {
    return { error: 'Invalid fields' };
  }
  
  try {
    const item = await itemsService.createItem(validatedFields.data);
    revalidatePath('/inventory');
    return { success: true, item };
  } catch (error) {
    return { error: 'Failed to create item' };
  }
}
```

### File Locations
**Frontend Component Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Pages to Create:**
- `app/(dashboard)/inventory/page.tsx` - Main inventory listing with grid/list view
- `app/(dashboard)/inventory/new/page.tsx` - Add new item form page
- `app/(dashboard)/inventory/[id]/page.tsx` - Item details view  
- `app/(dashboard)/inventory/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit item form page

**Components to Build:**
- `components/inventory/ItemForm.tsx` - Main add/edit form with photo upload
- `components/inventory/ItemCard.tsx` - Item display card with thumbnail
- `components/inventory/ItemGrid.tsx` - Responsive grid layout for items
- `components/inventory/ItemModal.tsx` - Item details modal for editing
- `components/camera/PhotoUpload.tsx` - File upload with preview and validation
- `components/locations/LocationSelector.tsx` - Hierarchical location picker

**Service Layer Extensions:**
- `lib/actions/items.ts` - Server actions for item CRUD operations
- `lib/actions/photos.ts` - Photo upload and processing actions
- `lib/services/photos.ts` - Photo storage and management service
- `lib/utils/photos.ts` - Photo processing utilities with Sharp.js

**Local Photo Storage:**
- `public/uploads/photos/` - Temporary local photo storage organized by item ID
- `lib/utils/fileStorage.ts` - Local file management utilities

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Required Dependencies:**
- **React 19**: `useActionState`, `useOptimistic` for modern form handling
- **Next.js 15.2**: App Router, Server Actions, built-in image optimization
- **Sharp.js**: Image processing for thumbnails and optimization
- **Zod**: Form validation using existing schemas from Story 1.2
- **shadcn/ui**: UI component library with Tailwind CSS

**Image Processing Configuration:**
```typescript
// lib/utils/photos.ts - Sharp.js configuration
import sharp from 'sharp';

export const processImage = async (buffer: Buffer) => {
  const processed = await sharp(buffer)
    .resize(1920, 1080, { fit: 'inside', withoutEnlargement: true })
    .jpeg({ quality: 85, progressive: true })
    .toBuffer();

  const thumbnail = await sharp(buffer)
    .resize(200, 200, { fit: 'cover' })
    .jpeg({ quality: 80 })
    .toBuffer();

  return { processed, thumbnail };
};
```
