### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.7 Production Infrastructure** - AWS S3 integration completed with CloudFront CDN for photo delivery. All photos now stored with multi-format support (WebP, AVIF, JPEG) using CloudFront URLs. Export functionality must include these CDN URLs for photo accessibility. The S3 architecture provides reliable photo URL references that won't expire like presigned URLs.

### Export Service Architecture Context
**Backend Service Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]

The export functionality follows the established service layer pattern with business logic separation:

```typescript
// lib/services/exports.ts - ExportService Implementation
class ExportService {
  async createExport(userId: string, exportType: 'csv'): Promise<ExportJob> {
    return await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
      // 1. Validate user permissions
      await this.validateUserAccess(tx, userId);

      // 2. Create export job with progress tracking
      const exportJob = await tx.exportJob.create({
        data: {
          userId,
          exportType,
          status: 'pending',
          filename: this.generateFilename(exportType),
        },
      });

      // 3. Queue background processing for large datasets
      await this.queueExportGeneration(exportJob.id);

      return exportJob;
    });
  }

  async generateCSVExport(userId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Retrieve complete user inventory with all relationships
    const items = await prisma.item.findMany({
      where: { household: { members: { some: { userId } } } },
      include: {
        location: true,
        photos: { select: { originalUrl: true, thumbnailUrl: true } },
        tags: { include: { tag: true } },
        household: { select: { name: true } },
      },
    });

    // Generate CSV with comprehensive data
    return this.formatAsCSV(items);
  }
}
```

### Database Schema Context
**Export Data Structure** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

The export includes data from multiple related tables:

```sql
-- Items table with all inventory data
SELECT
  items.name,
  items.description,
  items.quantity,
  items.unit,
  items.purchase_price,
  items.current_value,
  items.purchase_date,
  items.status,
  locations.path as location_path,
  locations.name as location_name,
  households.name as household_name,
  items.created_at,
  items.updated_at
FROM items
JOIN locations ON items.location_id = locations.id
JOIN households ON items.household_id = households.id
WHERE household_members.user_id = ?
```

### API Design Pattern Context
**RESTful Export Endpoints** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-design-patterns]

Following established API patterns:

```typescript
// app/api/v1/exports/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest): Promise<Response> {
  try {
    // 1. Authentication using NextAuth session
    const session = await auth();
    if (!session?.user) {
      return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
    }

    // 2. Validate request body using Zod
    const body = await request.json();
    const validatedData = CreateExportSchema.parse(body);

    // 3. Create export job
    const exportJob = await exportsService.createExport(session.user.id, validatedData.type);

    // 4. Standard response format
    return Response.json({
      data: exportJob,
      meta: {
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        version: 'v1',
      },
    }, { status: 201 });
  } catch (error) {
    // Standard error handling pattern
    console.error('Export API Error:', error);
    return Response.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}

export async function GET(request: NextRequest): Promise<Response> {
  // Export job status and download endpoint
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const jobId = searchParams.get('jobId');

  if (!jobId) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Missing jobId parameter' }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const exportJob = await exportsService.getExportStatus(jobId);

  if (exportJob.status === 'completed') {
    // Return download URL with secure access
    return Response.json({
      data: {
        ...exportJob,
        downloadUrl: `/api/v1/exports/${jobId}/download`,
      },
    });
  }

  return Response.json({ data: exportJob });
}
```

### CSV Export Format Specification
**Comprehensive Data Export Structure**

The CSV export includes all essential inventory data with proper formatting:

```csv
"Item Name","Description","Quantity","Unit","Purchase Price","Current Value","Purchase Date","Status","Location Path","Location Name","Household","Photo URLs","Tags","Created Date","Updated Date"
"Power Drill","Cordless 18V drill with battery",1,"piece",159.99,140.00,"2024-01-15","available","Home/Garage/Workbench","Workbench","Johnson Family","https://d1234.cloudfront.net/original.jpg,https://d1234.cloudfront.net/thumb.jpg","tools,power-tools","2024-01-15T10:30:00Z","2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
```

**Column Specifications:**
- **Item Name**: Item name with CSV escaping for commas and quotes
- **Description**: Full item description
- **Quantity/Unit**: Inventory tracking information
- **Financial Data**: Purchase price, current value, purchase date
- **Status**: Current item status (available, borrowed, etc.)
- **Location Data**: Both hierarchical path and location name
- **Photo URLs**: CloudFront CDN URLs separated by commas
- **Tags**: All associated tags separated by commas
- **Timestamps**: ISO format for created/updated dates

### File Structure for Story 1.8

**New Files to Create:**
- `lib/services/exports.ts` - ExportService class with CSV generation
- `lib/types/exports.ts` - Export-related TypeScript interfaces
- `lib/validation/exports.ts` - Zod schemas for export validation
- `app/api/v1/exports/route.ts` - Export API endpoints (POST, GET)
- `app/api/v1/exports/[id]/download/route.ts` - Download endpoint
- `app/(dashboard)/settings/export/page.tsx` - Export UI interface
- `tests/unit/services/exports.test.ts` - Unit tests for ExportService

**Files to Update:**

- `lib/types/index.ts` - Add export types
- `lib/validation/index.ts` - Add export validation schemas

### Authentication and Security Context - QA Enhanced
**User Data Isolation** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]

**QA CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS** - Export functionality must implement enhanced security measures:

```typescript
// QA ENHANCED: Secure user data validation with boundary condition testing
async validateUserAccess(tx: PrismaTransactionClient, userId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Step 1: Validate user exists and has household access
  const householdAccess = await tx.householdMember.findFirst({
    where: {
      userId,
      // QA ENHANCEMENT: Ensure membership is active
      household: {
        // Add additional household-level validation
        id: { not: null }
      }
    },
    include: {
      household: true,
      user: true
    },
  });

  if (!householdAccess) {
    throw new SecurityError('User has no accessible household data');
  }

  // QA CRITICAL: Log security validation for audit trail
  await this.logSecurityValidation(userId, householdAccess.household.id, 'export_access_granted');
}

// QA CRITICAL: Row-level security with strict household membership enforcement
const items = await prisma.item.findMany({
  where: {
    // QA ENHANCEMENT: Double-layer security validation
    AND: [
      {
        household: {
          members: {
            some: {
              userId,
              // Ensure active membership
              joinedAt: { lte: new Date() }
            },
          },
        },
      },
      // Additional boundary condition: ensure item belongs to accessible household
      {
        householdId: {
          in: await this.getUserAccessibleHouseholdIds(userId)
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  // ... include related data with ownership validation
});

// QA CRITICAL: Photo ownership validation
async validatePhotoOwnership(tx: PrismaTransactionClient, photoUrl: string, userId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const photoOwnership = await tx.itemPhoto.findFirst({
    where: {
      originalUrl: photoUrl,
      item: {
        household: {
          members: {
            some: { userId }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  });

  return !!photoOwnership;
}
```

### Performance Considerations - QA Enhanced
**Large Dataset Handling with Memory Optimization**

**QA CRITICAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS** - For inventories with 500+ items, implement enhanced performance strategies:

```typescript
// QA CRITICAL: Background job processing with chunked processing and streaming
async queueExportGeneration(exportJobId: string): Promise<void> {
  // QA ENHANCEMENT: Check dataset size and route accordingly
  const itemCount = await this.getExportItemCount(exportJobId);

  if (itemCount > 100) {
    // Use chunked processing for large datasets
    await this.processLargeExportJob(exportJobId, itemCount);
  } else {
    // Standard processing for smaller datasets
    await this.processStandardExportJob(exportJobId);
  }
}

// QA CRITICAL: Chunked processing to prevent timeout
async processLargeExportJob(exportJobId: string, totalItems: number): Promise<void> {
  const CHUNK_SIZE = 50; // QA RECOMMENDED: Process 50 items at a time
  const totalChunks = Math.ceil(totalItems / CHUNK_SIZE);

  let processedChunks = 0;

  // QA ENHANCEMENT: Use streaming CSV generation
  const csvStream = this.createStreamingCSVWriter(exportJobId);

  for (let offset = 0; offset < totalItems; offset += CHUNK_SIZE) {
    // Process chunk with memory-efficient query
    const chunk = await this.getItemsChunk(offset, CHUNK_SIZE);
    await csvStream.writeChunk(chunk);

    processedChunks++;

    // QA CRITICAL: Update progress and check memory usage
    await this.updateProgress(exportJobId, (processedChunks / totalChunks) * 100);

    // QA ENHANCEMENT: Memory pressure check
    if (process.memoryUsage().heapUsed > 100 * 1024 * 1024) { // 100MB limit
      await this.performGarbageCollection();
    }
  }

  await csvStream.finalize();
}

// QA CRITICAL: Memory-efficient streaming CSV generation
class StreamingCSVWriter {
  private stream: WriteStream;
  private headerWritten = false;

  async writeChunk(items: Item[]): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.headerWritten) {
      await this.writeHeaders();
      this.headerWritten = true;
    }

    for (const item of items) {
      const csvRow = this.formatItemAsCSVRow(item);
      await this.stream.write(csvRow + '\n');
    }

    // QA ENHANCEMENT: Force stream flush to prevent memory buildup
    await this.stream.flush();
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern Context
**Standard Error Response Format**

Building on established error handling patterns:

```typescript
// Standardized error codes for export functionality
export const ExportErrorCodes = {
  UNAUTHORIZED: 'EXPORT_001',
  DATASET_TOO_LARGE: 'EXPORT_002',
  EXPORT_GENERATION_FAILED: 'EXPORT_003',
  PHOTO_ACCESS_DENIED: 'EXPORT_004',
  MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: 'EXPORT_005',
  BACKGROUND_JOB_FAILED: 'EXPORT_006',
} as const;

// Standard error response format
interface ExportErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: Record<string, any>;
    timestamp: string;
  };
}
```

### Photo URL Integration
**CloudFront CDN URL Format**

Building on Story 1.7's S3/CloudFront infrastructure:

```typescript
// Photo URL formatting for export
private formatPhotoUrls(photos: ItemPhoto[]): string {
  return photos
    .map(photo => `${photo.originalUrl},${photo.thumbnailUrl}`)
    .join(';'); // Use semicolon to separate different photos
}

// Example output:
// "https://d1234.cloudfront.net/item-123-original.webp,https://d1234.cloudfront.net/item-123-thumb.webp"
```
