## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 2.1 Complete** - AWS S3 infrastructure and Sharp.js processing pipeline are fully implemented. The photo upload API at `app/api/v1/items/[id]/photos/route.ts` handles server-side processing with 100KB compression target. This story builds the frontend interface that will consume these backend services.

### Frontend Architecture Context
**React 19 + Next.js 15.2 Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#camera-integration-architecture]

The camera integration follows modern React 19 patterns with Server Actions:

```typescript
// Camera Component with React 19 Features
'use client';

import { useActionState } from 'react';
import { uploadPhotoAction } from '@/lib/actions/photos';

export function CameraCapture({ itemId }: { itemId: string }) {
  const [uploadState, uploadPhoto, isPending] = useActionState(
    uploadPhotoAction,
    { success: false, error: null }
  );

  const handleCapture = async (blob: Blob) => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('photo', blob, 'captured-photo.jpg');
    formData.append('itemId', itemId);

    uploadPhoto(formData);
  };

  // Camera API integration with error handling
  const startCamera = async () => {
    try {
      const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        video: {
          facingMode: 'environment', // Rear camera preferred
          width: { ideal: 1920 },
          height: { ideal: 1080 }
        }
      });

      if (videoRef.current) {
        videoRef.current.srcObject = stream;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      setError('Camera access denied or not available');
    }
  };
}
```

**Key Features Required:**
- Real-time camera preview with device camera selection
- Photo capture with automatic compression and orientation correction
- Batch photo processing with progress indicators
- Offline photo queue with automatic sync when connection restored

### Component Architecture Context
**UI Component Structure** [Source: architecture/components.md#camera]

Following the established component library patterns:

```typescript
interface CameraComponents {
  CameraCapture: "Native camera integration with preview";
  PhotoEditor: "Basic crop, rotate, and enhancement tools";
  PhotoGallery: "Grid view of item photos with lightbox";
  PhotoUpload: "Drag-drop and batch photo processing";
}
```

**shadcn/ui Integration:**
- Use `Button` components for camera actions with proper sizing
- Implement `Dialog` for photo preview and editing modals
- Use `Progress` components for upload status indication
- Apply `Card` layout for photo grid display

### Technical Stack Context
**Camera API Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#react-19]

React 19 patterns for state management:

```typescript
// Modern React 19 State Management
function PhotoUploadFlow() {
  const [photos, setPhotos] = useState(initialPhotos);
  const [optimisticPhotos, addOptimisticPhoto] = useOptimistic(
    photos,
    (state, newPhoto) => [...state, { ...newPhoto, id: 'temp-' + Date.now() }]
  );

  const handlePhotoUpload = async (photoData) => {
    addOptimisticPhoto(photoData); // Immediate UI update

    const result = await uploadPhotoAction(photoData);
    if (result.success) {
      setPhotos(prev => [...prev, result.photo]);
    }
  };
}
```

**Progressive Web App Integration:**
- Camera functionality works offline with queue sync
- Service Worker caches camera interface for instant loading
- Push notifications for upload completion when app is backgrounded

### Photo Processing Integration
**Sharp.js Backend Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#image-processing]

The frontend will integrate with the existing photo processing pipeline:

```typescript
// Integration with existing backend services
const photoUploadFlow = {
  frontend: "Camera capture → Canvas processing → FormData creation",
  backend: "Sharp.js compression → S3 upload → CDN distribution",
  response: "Photo URLs and metadata returned to frontend"
};
```

**API Integration Points:**
- `POST /api/v1/items/[id]/photos` - Main upload endpoint (already exists)
- Progress tracking through Server-Sent Events
- Error handling with specific error codes for different failure types

### File Structure for Story 2.2
**New Files to Create** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Camera Components:**
- `components/camera/CameraCapture.tsx` - Native camera integration with preview
- `components/camera/PhotoEditor.tsx` - Basic crop, rotate, and enhancement tools
- `components/camera/PhotoGallery.tsx` - Grid view of item photos with lightbox
- `components/camera/PhotoUpload.tsx` - Enhanced drag-drop and batch processing
- `components/camera/index.ts` - Barrel exports for camera components

**Custom Hooks:**
- `lib/hooks/useCamera.ts` - Camera integration and permissions management
- `lib/hooks/usePhotoUpload.ts` - Upload progress and queue management
- `lib/hooks/useMediaDevices.ts` - Device camera selection and capabilities

**Server Actions:**
- `lib/actions/photos.ts` - Enhanced photo upload actions with progress tracking
- `lib/actions/camera.ts` - Camera-specific server actions

**Utility Functions:**
- `lib/utils/camera.ts` - Camera API helpers and device detection
- `lib/utils/imageProcessing.ts` - Client-side image processing utilities

**Type Definitions:**
- `lib/types/camera.ts` - Camera-related TypeScript interfaces
- Enhanced `lib/types/photos.ts` - Extended photo types with upload states

### Authentication and Permissions Context
**Camera Permissions** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#progressive-web-app-configuration]

PWA camera permissions and security:

```typescript
// Camera permission request with graceful fallback
const requestCameraPermission = async () => {
  try {
    const permission = await navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'camera' });
    if (permission.state === 'granted') {
      return true;
    } else if (permission.state === 'prompt') {
      // Request permission through getUserMedia
      const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true });
      stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
      return true;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to file upload only
    return false;
  }
};
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Camera access requires HTTPS in production
- Proper handling of camera permissions denied state
- Fallback to file upload when camera unavailable
- No sensitive data stored in camera component state

### Critical Risk Mitigation Context
**QA Risk Assessment Summary - HIGH RISK (7.5/10)** [QA Analysis: January 2025]

**CRITICAL RISKS IDENTIFIED:**
1. **Mobile Safari Camera API Compatibility** - Primary user platform risk
2. **HEIC File Support Security Gap** - Format validation vulnerability
3. **Mobile Device Memory Constraints** - Performance degradation risk
4. **PWA Infrastructure Missing** - Foundation requirements not implemented
5. **Camera Permission Denied Recovery** - Poor UX for denied permissions

**MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- PWA manifest and service worker foundation
- HEIC file validation and processing pipeline
- Mobile Safari compatibility testing plan
- Comprehensive error recovery workflows

### Enhanced State Management Architecture
**Advanced Error Recovery Patterns** [QA Design Recommendation]

```typescript
// Enhanced state machine for complex upload scenarios
type UploadState =
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'validating'; file: File; progress: number }
  | { status: 'compressing'; file: File; progress: number; quality: number }
  | { status: 'uploading'; progress: number; pausable: boolean; estimatedTime: number }
  | { status: 'paused'; resumeToken: string; bytesUploaded: number }
  | { status: 'success'; result: UploadResult; optimizations: CompressionStats }
  | { status: 'error'; error: UploadError; retryable: boolean; attempts: number };

// Retry configuration with exponential backoff
interface RetryConfig {
  maxAttempts: 3;
  backoffStrategy: 'exponential';
  baseDelay: 1000;
  maxDelay: 30000;
  retryableErrors: ['network', 'timeout', 'server-error', 'quota-exceeded'];
}
```

### Performance Optimization Context
**Mobile Performance** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#performance-optimization-strategy]

Critical performance considerations enhanced based on QA assessment:

```typescript
interface CameraPerformanceOptimization {
  imageCapture: {
    canvasOptimization: "Use OffscreenCanvas for background processing";
    compressionStrategy: "Client-side compression with quality fallback";
    thumbnailGeneration: "Generate thumbnails locally with memory limits";
    heicProcessing: "HEIC to JPEG conversion with progress tracking";
  };

  memoryManagement: {
    streamCleanup: "Properly stop camera streams to prevent memory leaks";
    blobURL: "Revoke object URLs after use to free memory";
    largeFileHandling: "Stream large files with chunk processing";
    memoryMonitoring: "Track memory usage and trigger cleanup";
  };

  batteryOptimization: {
    cameraSleep: "Automatically stop camera after inactivity";
    processingQueue: "Batch process multiple photos to reduce CPU usage";
    backgroundProcessing: "Use Web Workers for heavy image processing";
    safariWorkarounds: "iOS Safari specific power management";
  };
}
```

**Bundle Size Optimization:**
- Lazy load camera components to reduce initial bundle size
- Use dynamic imports for camera-specific utilities
- Optimize image processing libraries for tree-shaking
- Implement feature detection to avoid loading unsupported functionality
