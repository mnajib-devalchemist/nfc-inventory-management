## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 2.2 Infrastructure Complete** - Photo upload API, camera integration, and PWA infrastructure are fully implemented. The PhotoUpload component at `components/camera/PhotoUpload.tsx` and CameraCapture at `components/camera/CameraCapture.tsx` provide the foundation for this story. The Sharp.js processing pipeline and S3 storage are operational with HEIC support and Safari compatibility.

### Frontend Architecture Context
**React 19 + Next.js 15.2 Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#react-19-nextjs-152-structure]

This story extends the camera integration with comprehensive item management:

```typescript
// Enhanced Item Management with Photos
'use client';

import { useActionState, useOptimistic } from 'react';
import { updateItemAction } from '@/lib/actions/items';
import { PhotoGallery } from '@/components/camera/PhotoGallery';
import { PhotoEditor } from '@/components/camera/PhotoEditor';

export function ItemDetailPage({ item }: { item: ItemWithPhotos }) {
  const [optimisticPhotos, updateOptimisticPhotos] = useOptimistic(
    item.photos,
    (state, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'SET_PRIMARY':
          return state.map(photo => ({
            ...photo,
            isPrimary: photo.id === action.photoId
          }));
        case 'DELETE':
          return state.filter(photo => photo.id !== action.photoId);
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }
  );

  const [updateState, updateItem, isPending] = useActionState(
    updateItemAction,
    { success: false, error: null }
  );

  return (
    <div className="item-detail">
      <PhotoGallery
        photos={optimisticPhotos}
        onPhotoEdit={handlePhotoEdit}
        onSetPrimary={handleSetPrimary}
        onDelete={handlePhotoDelete}
      />
      <ItemForm
        item={item}
        onUpdate={updateItem}
        isPending={isPending}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Component Architecture Context
**Enhanced UI Component Structure** [Source: architecture/components.md#frontend-components]

Building on the camera components from Story 2.2:

```typescript
interface EnhancedInventoryComponents {
  ItemForm: "Enhanced form with integrated photo upload and editing";
  PhotoGallery: "Grid view of item photos with lightbox and zoom";
  PhotoEditor: "Crop, rotate, and enhancement tools with undo/redo";
  ItemDetailPage: "Complete item view with photo carousel and metadata";
  ItemCard: "Updated card with primary photo thumbnail display";
  PhotoMetadataView: "EXIF data display with privacy controls";
}
```

**shadcn/ui Integration:**
- Use `Dialog` components for photo editing and confirmation modals
- Implement `Card` and `Badge` for photo metadata display
- Apply `Button` components with proper loading states for photo actions
- Use `AlertDialog` for photo deletion confirmations

### Technical Stack Context
**React 19 State Management Patterns** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#react-19]

Advanced state management for photo operations:

```typescript
// Photo Management with Optimistic Updates
function ItemPhotoManager({ itemId }: { itemId: string }) {
  const [photos, setPhotos] = useState(initialPhotos);
  const [optimisticPhotos, updateOptimisticPhotos] = useOptimistic(
    photos,
    (state, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'ADD_PHOTO':
          return [...state, { ...action.photo, id: 'temp-' + Date.now() }];
        case 'SET_PRIMARY':
          return state.map(photo => ({
            ...photo,
            isPrimary: photo.id === action.photoId
          }));
        case 'UPDATE_METADATA':
          return state.map(photo =>
            photo.id === action.photoId
              ? { ...photo, metadata: action.metadata }
              : photo
          );
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }
  );

  const handlePhotoUpload = async (photoData) => {
    updateOptimisticPhotos({ type: 'ADD_PHOTO', photo: photoData });

    const result = await uploadPhotoAction(itemId, photoData);
    if (result.success) {
      setPhotos(prev => [...prev, result.photo]);
    }
  };
}
```

**Image Processing Integration:**
- Client-side photo editing with Canvas API for crop and rotate
- Integration with existing Sharp.js backend pipeline for processing
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback during photo operations

### File Structure for Story 2.3

**Item Management Components:**
- `components/inventory/ItemDetailPage.tsx` - Complete item view with photo carousel
- `components/inventory/ItemForm.tsx` - Enhanced form with photo integration
- `components/inventory/ItemCard.tsx` - Updated with primary photo thumbnail

**Photo Management Utilities:**
- `lib/utils/photoEditing.ts` - Client-side photo manipulation utilities

### Database Schema Context
**Photo and Item Relationships** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

The existing database schema supports photo relationships:

```prisma
model Item {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  description String?
  photos      Photo[]
  // ... other fields
}

model Photo {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  itemId       String
  item         Item     @relation(fields: [itemId], references: [id])
  originalUrl  String
  thumbnailUrl String
  isPrimary    Boolean  @default(false)
  metadata     Json?    // EXIF data and upload info
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

**Key Database Operations:**
- Photo reordering with `orderIndex` field updates
- Primary photo management with atomic updates
- Soft delete implementation with `deletedAt` timestamp
- Metadata storage in JSON field for flexibility

### Security and Privacy Context - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
**Photo Security Considerations** [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md + QA Security Assessment]

**CRITICAL SECURITY IMPLEMENTATIONS (QA Risk: 9.0/10):**

```typescript
// Enhanced Photo Metadata Privacy Controls
interface PhotoPrivacySettings {
  stripLocation: boolean;
  stripDeviceInfo: boolean;
  stripTimestamp: boolean;
  stripCameraInfo: boolean;
  allowDownload: boolean;
  enableAuditLogging: boolean;
  gdprCompliant: boolean;
  retentionPeriod: number; // days
}

// Comprehensive Photo Access Control
interface PhotoPermissions {
  canView: boolean;
  canEdit: boolean;
  canDelete: boolean;
  canSetPrimary: boolean;
  canAccessMetadata: boolean;
  canExportData: boolean;
  householdRole: 'admin' | 'member' | 'viewer';
}

// Photo Security Validation
interface PhotoSecurityValidation {
  maxFileSize: number;
  allowedMimeTypes: string[];
  contentValidation: boolean;
  malwareScanning: boolean;
  rateLimiting: {
    maxUploadsPerHour: number;
    maxConcurrentOperations: number;
  };
}
```

**MANDATORY SECURITY FEATURES:**

### Performance Optimization Context
**Photo Performance Strategies** [Source: architecture/performance-scalability.md#frontend-performance-optimization]

Advanced photo performance optimizations:

```typescript
interface PhotoPerformanceOptimization {
  lazyLoading: {
    implementation: "Intersection Observer for photo thumbnails";
    strategy: "Load photos as they enter viewport";
    priority: "Primary photos load first, then additional photos";
  };

  caching: {
    thumbnails: "Browser cache with service worker for offline access";
    fullSize: "CDN caching with CloudFront optimization";
    editing: "Local storage for unsaved photo edits";
  };

  imageOptimization: {
    responsiveImages: "Multiple sizes for different screen densities";
    formatOptimization: "WebP for modern browsers, JPEG fallback";
    progressiveLoading: "Blur-up technique for smooth loading";
  };
}
```
